# Honolulu Condos

Repository containing data and Jupyter notebook detailing analysis of Honolulu condos.

The city of Honolulu in Hawaii is currently undergoing a surge of new development. The epicenter of this development lies in Kakaako, an area between downtown
Honolulu and Waikiki, where the Howard Hughes Corporation is planning to redevelop and build an upscale community called Ward Village. As new condos in the city
appear to be shifting towards luxury properties, I will be analyzing trends in condo development to gain a better understanding of the changing landscape and how it
affects local residents and the current housing situation.
